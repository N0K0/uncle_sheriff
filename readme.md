## The steps are simple enough:

1) Fetch all Flashbots mev blocks from the block.flashbots.net api
1) Find all Flashbots bundle TXes that ended up in an uncle
1) Find all Flashbots bundle TXes that was then later used in the main chain.
1) Filter on TXes which has gasPrice 0
1) Filter on TXes which are out of gasPrice order
1) Output into a reasonable format


### Fetch all Flashbots mev blocks from the block.flashbots.net api
Simple enough. The API is awesome and nice. I'm locked to 10000 lookback, assuming FB core has its own api :')
https://blocks.flashbots.net/

### Fetch all uncles from geth
Go through all flashbots blocks, check if the block became an uncle

### Save all TXes from the 


## Things to figure out:

When can we reasonably discard a Flashbots TX from our cache?
* We can check the from address and figure out if the TX nonce has been used for another tx?

What other sources are there for false positives?
* The user may have resent the same bundle, need to find out how to check for this. 
  Possible to just concat the different tx hashes and use that as an key?
